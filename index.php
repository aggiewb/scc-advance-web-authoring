                <p>Hi! My name is Aggie, and I am working towards a web development certificate from Seattle Central College with additional focus on web 
                scripting and software development, and I currently live in the Maple Leaf neighborhood with my husband. I have experience in HTML, CSS, 
                Python, JS, SQL, PHP, Django, and Java.</p>

                <p>I grew up in Mobile, Alabama where I loved spending time on the coast. I later attended the University of Southern Mississippi and 
                earned my bachelor's degree in Elementary Education, but ultimately, I decided the career wasn't for me.</p>
                
                <p>I then enlisted in the Air Force and was trained extensively in medical laboratory science. After my training, I was stationed in 
                Misawa, Japan where I worked for two years and earned my associate's degree in Medical Laboratory Technology. Once back in the states, I 
                moved to Seattle and continued working as a medical laboratory scientist.</p> 
            
                <p>In the beginning of 2019, I was interested in programming and a possible career change, so I took the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses 
                at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>. I loved the problem solving and creativity that coding gave 
                me, and I decided that I wanted to expand my knowledge and make the leap into changing careers. By September, I became a full-time web 
                development student.</p>
            
                <p>Currently when I'm not studying programming, I enjoy spending time with my husband, reading, playing video games and board games, traveling, 
                or working on personal programming projects. I aspire to learn as much as I can so I can put ideas into motion.</p>
