Here we’ll discuss three responsive JavaScript based galleries, Nanogallery2, PhotoSwipe, and Galleria.</p>

Second, the OEM license for an unlimited number of websites or a single project, application, or theme costs $105 USD. These licenses help ensure that the tool is actively maintained and provides support for a limited time. The main features that this gallery includes are multiple gallery layouts, grid, justified, cascading, and mosaic, thumbnail hover and touch effects, and blurred image preview during image download. Most features are supported in Firefox 6+, Chrome 16+, Edge 13+, IE 11+, Opera 12.1+, Yandex 14.12+, iPhone 5+ / iOS 6+, and Safari 6.2+ (Brisbois).</p>

    <p>PhotoSwipe is free to use for commercial projects as it has been released under the MIT license. The main features that this gallery includes are use of all device touch gestures, unique URLs for each gallery item, and zooming of images on desktop and progressive loading of images as data arrives on desktop. The script is supported in desktop Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and IE 8+. It provides mobile support in Android 2.3.7+, iOS 5+, Windows Phone 7+, BlackBerry OS 10+, and devices with multiple input methods such as Surface and Chromebook Pixel (Semenov).</p>

    <p>Galleria is also free to use for commercial projects as it has been released under the MIT license.The main features that this gallery includes are the availability to not only use images but also sources such as Flickr, Vimeo, and YouTube. Some other features are multiple themes for layout, the ability to create your own theme, and the use of device touch gestures.
